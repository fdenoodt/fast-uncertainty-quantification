- [Deep Generative Modeling | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-64087-2)
  book on generative modeling: contains a section on uncertainty quantification (under "hybrid modeling")

  towards the end of the video: talks about calibration and evaluation

- university lecture on bayesian networks/maximimum likelihood estimation. they show how to do it for discrete domains, and also give good insights.

- Images doesn't yet work: maybe if ensure that views "follow different paths" during inference could help.
  - e.g. through similarity regularization between latent representations of views from same original image
  - dropout?
